Git_instructions part 2


0) listing all the config key-values
		git config -l
	 (or) git config --list

1) Cloning a remote repository into our machine (i.e.make a copy of a remote repository in your local machine)
		cd desired-folder-location
		git clone https://github.com/udacity/course-git-blog-project

2) Creating any file from git console
		touch "<pwd>/additional filepath/filename"

3) ignoring files in local repo:
		- specify filepaths or directorypaths in ".gitignore"  in order to omit them from being tracked by git
		- creating ".gitignore" file in the local directory
				touch .gitignore 

4) knowing changes in the local repo:
		git status 

5) knowing changes done in a specific file:
		git diff myfile.html

6) knowing previous commits i.e. commit history
		- we can find a long funky number called Commit-ID associated with each commit
		git log					(shows entire commit history)
		git log -5				(shows only past 5 commits)

7) knowing the exact changes done in a given commit
		step 1:
			you need to retrieve the [commitID] using "git log" and the write the following command.
		step 2:
			the following command displays the modified lines of the files commited on the specifed commitId
				git show [commitID]			
			
8) Funky Scenario for better perspective:
		1. set of changes done in "file1". And the file1 is commited.
		2. Now, if we want to add additional changes to "file1", but we do not want to create another commit.
		3. In other words, we want the second set of changes done to "file1" to reflect directly in the latest(last/previous) commit done (HEAD pointing commit), that too without any change in the existing commit message.
		4. Please follow the below steps to acheive it.
			git add file1
			git commit --amend
		5. A VI editor appears after the second command. We simply have to save & exit it 
					<ESC key>
					:wq

9) Terminology & Trivia:
		- There are three places of Git where file changes can reside.
			1. Working Directory
		   /		|
		  /			|	[adding]
		 /		   \|/
		/	2. Staging Directory
	   /|\			|
		|			|	[Commiting]
		|		   \|/				
		|	3. Repository
		|			|
		|			|	[checkout]
